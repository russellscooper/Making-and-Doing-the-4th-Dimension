## Put on 4D goggles now ...

<h1>This repo turns numbers into your playground!</h1>
<p>You will find projects here that are adapted from the book "Things to Make and Do in the Fourth Dimension" by Matt Parker </p>
<p>The goal of this repository is not strictly academic! It is meant for the curious, the bold, and the bored.</p>
<p>Each chapter will contain my vairous attempts to program conecpts from Mr. Parkers book. In the spirit of the book, I will try not to give 
to much of my thinking away. Exploring the code here is part of the challenge. If you really want answers go buy the book right now. \
If you dont want to know the answers then consider this a challenge. Try to figure out what each objects purpose is and expand that purpose. The 
goal is to show that mathematics has a deep purpose that is interesting and even fun. </p>
<p>Then go buy the book!</p>

<p>Ok, I will shut up now.</p>
